            And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.
You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! And the hat. She's a witch!

You don't vote for kings. Well, what do you want? The nose? Burn her anyway! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

It's only a model.
Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Well, we did do the nose.

Bloody Peasant!
What do you mean?
Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!
I dunno. Must be a king.
Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! It's only a model. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Did you dress her up like this? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

Well, what do you want?
Where'd you get the coconuts?
Well, we did do the nose.
How do you know she is a witch? Bloody Peasant! I have to push the pram a lot. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!

You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Bring her forward! Well, we did do the nose. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Well, she turned me into a newt.

Burn her! Why? The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! You don't vote for kings. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!

Oh, ow! Well, what do you want? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.

Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Why do you think that she is a witch? Now, look here, my good man. Where'd you get the coconuts? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.

Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Why do you think that she is a witch? Well, I didn't vote for you. Oh, ow!

You don't vote for kings. But you are dressed as one… Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! You don't vote for kings. Bloody Peasant! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!

She looks like one. But you are dressed as one… Well, how'd you become king, then? The nose? We want a shrubbery!!

The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. How do you know she is a witch? Bring her forward! Look, my liege!

But you are dressed as one… What a strange person. Now, look here, my good man. Be quiet! Well, what do you want?

Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Well, we did do the nose. She looks like one. Bloody Peasant!
